Fuel Frenzy is a 2D endless runner game developed in Unity. The player controls a car that automatically accelerates over time, increasing the difficulty.

Key Mechanics:

🏎️ Increasing Speed: The game gets faster the longer you survive.

⛽ Fuel System: Fuel decreases constantly over time. Collect fuel cans to stay in the game—if the tank runs dry, it's Game Over.

❤️ Health System: The player starts with 3 Hearts. Hitting an obstacle reduces one heart. The game ends if you hit an obstacle with no hearts left or run out of fuel.
